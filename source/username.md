## Grace Period

Every Username has a **10 day** grace period for renewals after expiration.

## Third-Party Apps

We actively encourage other developers to add [Nano.to Usernames](/username-advanced) to their apps. This makes your Nano address "findable by Username" on a growing list of applications & games. Imagine playing a video game from Steam, and finding your Nano Username and Address on it, because the game supports Nano. Pretty rad!

> If privacy is your thing, don't get a Username for a particular address, and avoid the publicity.
