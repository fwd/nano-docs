## Dataset

We encourage other to add support for [Nano.to Usernames](https://nano.to/known.json) on their apps. This makes your Nano address "findable by Username" on a growing list of applications, games and sercices. 

```pthon
https://nano.to/known.json
```

> If privacy is your thing, don't get a Username for a particular address, and avoid the publicity.
