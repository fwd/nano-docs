## How To Use

 Lease a Name. That's it. Every 24 hrs, you get (0.001 - 0.1) Nano. 

Actual payment amount may vary, but usually stays in this range, on average.

## Guidelines

- You can purchase multiple Usernames with the same NANO address.
- You will be paid for every Username, up to first 5 Usernames. 
- Address can't have more than 10,000 NANO balance (XNO, not USD).
- Address can't have more than 10,000 blocks (send and received payments).
- Address can't have more than 10 pending blocks from the Faucet address at the time of payment.
- The duration of the Lease does **not** affect the amount received. This might change in the future.
