## Introducing, Nano.to Faucet

This is not a typical Faucet.

You don’t have to do anything. Just enjoy the passive income.

Starting today, 20% of all Nano.to Username proceeds will go to the Nano.to Faucet address.

All funds are dispersed automatically every 12 hours. If you have an active Username, and less than 10000 XNO in your wallet, you’ll get your cut.

At the time of this writing, there are 68 active usernames. And 7 NANO in the Faucet. Thats 7 divided by 68. that is what you get. Your cut is relative to Nano.to growth.

If someone buys a $100 lease. $20 will go to the Faucet. And 1/68 will go to you. For the duration of your lease.

Lastly, the Faucet address is independent of the Nano.to address. Any and all funds in the Faucet address will be dispersed automatically every 12 hours. So if you wanted to donated to the entire group. Donate to the Nano.to Faucet.

No catch. NANO (and Colin) made this possible.

Let’s see how it goes.
